  "body": " Prep    Prep Text: Scientific Notation   To wield scientific notation properly, follow these arcane guidelines:      Find the coefficient. Move the decimal point so the number becomes at least 1 but less than 10. This becomes the coefficient . For example, 32,700 becomes \"3.27\".     Count the decimal steps. Count how many places you moved the decimal. That number becomes the exponent on your power of ten. If you moved the decimal to the left, the exponent is positive . If you moved it to the right, the exponent is negative .     Check your form. The final expression should look like , where and is an integer.       Convert 32,700 to scientific notation.    The decimal point would need to move to the left by 4 places.         To write 32,700 in scientific notation, move the decimal point four places to the left to place it after the first nonzero digit. This gives \"3.27\". Since the decimal moved left by four places, the exponent on 10 is 4.  So, .       Convert 0.0000089 to scientific notation.    The decimal point would need to move to the right by 6 places.         To write 0.0000089 in scientific notation, move the decimal point six places to the right to place it after the first nonzero digit. This gives \"8.9\". Because the decimal moved right by six places, the exponent on 10 is -6.  So, .     Why Use It?   Imagine trying to write the mass of the Earth (~ kg) or the mass of an electron (~ kg) without magical shorthand! Scientific notation saves parchment, keeps calculations neat, and makes comparison of large and small values easier.   Bonus Trick: Comparing Powers   Scientific notation reveals orders of magnitude . Two numbers differ by one order of magnitude for every tenfold difference. A dragon's hoard of gold coins is about three orders of magnitude larger than a goblin's pouch of . 3 was obtained by subtracting the exponents (6 - 3 = 3).  Likewise, a nanobot's processor that uses joules per operation is about two orders of magnitude smaller than a clunky space probe core drawing joules per operation. 2 was obtained by subtracting the exponents (-9 - (-7) = -2).   A Parting Word   With scientific notation in your spellbook, you can navigate the vast realms of physics, chemistry, and cosmic measurement. Write your numbers with care, check your powers of ten, and let no zero go unwielded.    Prep Questions: Scientific Notation    Convert standard notation to scientific notation.

  "body": " Prep    Prep Text: Significant Figures  Significant figures (or sig figs ) are the trustworthy digits in a measurement—those that carry real meaning. They help ensure precision and honesty in your scientific spells and calculations. To wield them wisely, follow these rules:    Start with what you see. All non-zero digits are significant. If your magic crystal reads 3.472 volts, that's four significant figures—each non-zero digit counts.   Zeroes have secrets.   Zeroes between non-zero digits are always significant. Example: 101 has three sig figs.  Leading zeroes (before any non-zero digits) are just placeholders—they don't count. Example: 0.0035 has two sig figs.  Trailing zeroes (after the decimal point) do count! Example: 2.300 has four sig figs.  Trailing zeroes in a whole number without a decimal? Mysterious! They may not be significant unless written in scientific notation. Example: 1500 could have two, three, or four sig figs—but definitely has four. To help clarify our communication in this guide, we will treat 1500 as two sig figs and as three sig figs.     Rounding  To round properly, follow these enchanted guidelines:   If digit to the right of your last desired digit is 6, 7, 8 or 9 then round the last desired digit up by one. Example: 2.46 → 2.5 (if keeping two sig figs)  If digit to the right of your last desired digit is 4, 3, 2, or 0 then keep the desired digit unchanged. Example: 2.14 → 2.1 (if keeping two sig figs)  If digit to the right of your last desired digit is 5 and there are other non-zero digits to the right of that 5, then round the last desired digit up by one. Example: 2.2501 → 2.3 (if keeping two sig figs)  If digit to the right of your last desired digit is 5 and there is no other non-zero digits to the right of that 5, then round to the nearest even digit. Example: 2.250 → 2.2 (if keeping two sig figs). Example: 2.35 → 2.4 (if keeping two sig figs).     Math with Care  When combining numbers in your calculations, the significant figures must follow the rules of magical balance:    Multiplying or dividing? Your answer should have the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest. For example, , but since has only two sig figs, you round your answer to .   Adding or subtracting? Line up your decimal points. Your answer should be rounded to the least precise decimal place from your inputs. For example, , which gets rounded to because is only precise to the tenths place.         How many significant figures are in the number: 42.02?    All non-zero digits count. Also, zeros between non-zero digits count.    42.02 has four significant figures.    42.02 has three non-zero digits: 4, 2, and 2. This counts as three significant figures so far. There is also a zero between two of the non-zero digits, which counts as a fourth significant figure.  So, 42.02 has four significant figures.       How many significant figures are in the number: 0.007?    All non-zero digits count. Leading zeros (zeros that occur to the left of the first non-zero digit) don't count.    0.007 has one significant figure.    0.007 has one non-zero digit: 7. This counts as one significant figures so far. There is also zeros, but all the zeros occur to the left of the 7 and are not between non-zero digits, so the zeros do not count.  So, 0.007 has one significant figure.     Why Use It?   Significant figures are like a secret code shared among scientists and magic folk alike. When you report a measurement of 1.27 meters, you're really telling your fellow colleague: \"I'm confident about the 1 and the 2, but the last digit—the 7—could vary a bit.\" That message is embedded in the number's three-digit significant figure code, quietly revealing both precision and uncertainty.   Bonus Trick: Using Sig Figs in Scientific Notation   Scientific notation and significant figures are best friends. Writing a number like clearly shows that you've got three sig figs—no more, no less.  Here's how to combine their powers:    → 2 sig figs    → 3 sig figs   → 1 sig fig  Each extra zero you intentionally include after the decimal adds more confidence to your measurement.   A Parting Word   With significant figures in your database, you can communicate your uncertainty the vast realms of physics, chemistry, and cosmic measurement. Write your numbers with care, check your sig figs, and let no leading zeros invade your notes.    Prep Questions: Significant Figures    Count the number of significant figures.
