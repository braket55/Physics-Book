Through a combination of instructional video, explanatory text, and practice questions, you will become adept at all things scientific notation.   Prep Videos: Scientific Notation  Watch the following video(s) to get an introduction to scientific notation.   Great Example of Interference     Prep Text: Scientific Notation  Read the following text to learn about scientific notation. Don't forget to try the checkpoint questions along the way!   What Is Scientific Notation?   Scientific Notation scientific notation    A standardized way to write very large or very small numbers using a coefficient between and multiplied by a power of ten. In scientific notation, a number has the form , where and is an integer. The exponent indicates how many places the decimal point has been moved.      Writing Numbers in Scientific Notation  To wield scientific notation properly, follow these arcane guidelines:     Find the coefficient. Move the decimal point so the number becomes at least but less than . This becomes the coefficient . For example, becomes .     Count the decimal steps. Count how many places you moved the decimal. That number becomes the exponent on your power of ten. If you moved the decimal to the left, the exponent is positive . If you moved it to the right, the exponent is negative .     Check your form. The final expression should look like , where and is an integer.       Convert to scientific notation.    The decimal point would need to move to the left by places.         To write in scientific notation, move the decimal point four places to the left to place it after the first nonzero digit. This gives . Since the decimal moved left by four places, the exponent on is .  So, .       Convert to scientific notation.    The decimal point would need to move to the right by places.         To write in scientific notation, move the decimal point six places to the right to place it after the first nonzero digit. This gives . Because the decimal moved right by six places, the exponent on the is .  So, .      Orders of Magnitude  Scientific notation reveals orders of magnitude . Two numbers differ by one order of magnitude for every tenfold difference. A dragon's hoard of gold coins is about 4 orders of magnitude larger than a goblin's pouch of coins. The order of magnitude, , was obtained by subtracting the exponents:   Likewise, a nanobot's processor that uses joules per operation is about two orders of magnitude smaller than a clunky space probe core drawing joules per operation. The two for order of magnitude was obtained by subtracting the original exponents:      How many orders of magnitude larger is compared to .    Subtract the exponents of the base .         Start with the exponent of the number we want to know how much larger: . Then subtract the exponent of the number we are comparing too: .     So, is orders of magnitude larger than .       How many orders of magnitude smaller is compared to .    Subtract the exponents of the base .         Start with the exponent of the number we want to know how much smaller: . Then subtract the exponent of the number we are comparing too: .     So, is orders of magnitude smaller than .      Why Use Scientific Notation?  Imagine trying to write the mass of the Earth (about kilograms), or the mass of an electron (about kilograms) without magical shorthand! Scientific notation saves parchment, keeps calculations neat, and makes comparison of large and small values easier.    A Parting Word  With scientific notation in your spellbook, you can navigate the vast realms of physics, chemistry, and cosmic measurement. Write your numbers with care, check your powers of ten, and let no zero go unwielded.     Prep Questions: Scientific Notation   Convert standard notation to scientific notation.

  "body": " Prep  This preparatory section will equip you with the knowledge and skills to wield significant figures with confidence and precision. Through a combination of instructional video, explanatory text, and practice questions, you will become adept at all things significant figures.   Prep Videos: Significant Figures  Watch the following video(s) to get an introduction to significant figures.   Great Example of Interference     Prep Text: Significant Figures  Read the following text to learn about significant figures. Don't forget to try the checkpoint questions along the way!   What Are Significant Figures?   Significant figures significant figures    The digits in a measured or calculated value that convey meaningful precision. Significant figures include all certain digits and the first uncertain digit.    Significant figures (or sig figs ) are the trustworthy digits in a measurement. They help ensure precision and honesty in your scientific spells and calculations.    Counting Significant Figures  To wield them wisely, follow these rules:   Start with what you see. All non-zero digits are significant. If your magic crystal reads volts, that's four significant figures; each non-zero digit counts.   Zeroes have secrets.   Zeroes between non-zero digits are always significant. Example: has three sig figs.  Leading zeroes (before any non-zero digits) are just placeholders; they don't count. Example: has two sig figs.  Trailing zeroes (after the decimal point) do count! Example: has four sig figs.  Trailing zeroes in a whole number without a decimal? Mysterious! They may not be significant unless written in scientific notation. Example: could have two, three, or four sig figs, but definitely has four. To help clarify our communication in this guide, we will treat as two sig figs and as three sig figs.        How many significant figures are in the number: ?    All non-zero digits count. Also, zeros between non-zero digits count.     has four significant figures.     has three non-zero digits: , , and . This counts as three significant figures so far. There is also a zero between two of the non-zero digits, which counts as a fourth significant figure.  So, has four significant figures.       How many significant figures are in the number: ?    All non-zero digits count. Leading zeros (zeros that occur to the left of the first non-zero digit) don't count.     has one significant figure.     has one non-zero digit: . This counts as one significant figures so far. There is also zeros, but all the zeros occur to the left of the and are not between non-zero digits, so the zeros do not count.  So, has one significant figure.      Rounding with Significant Figures  To round properly, follow these enchanted guidelines:   If digit to the right of your last desired digit is then round the last desired digit up by one. Example: (if keeping two sig figs).  If digit to the right of your last desired digit is then keep the desired digit unchanged. Example: (if keeping two sig figs)  If digit to the right of your last desired digit is and there are other non-zero digits to the right of that , then round the last desired digit up by one. Example: (if keeping two sig figs)  If digit to the right of your last desired digit is and there is no other non-zero digits to the right of that , then round to the nearest even digit. Example: (if keeping two sig figs). Example: (if keeping two sig figs).     Using Sig Figs in Calculations  When combining numbers in your calculations, the significant figures must follow the rules of magical balance:    Multiplying or dividing? Your answer should have the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest. For example, , but since has only two sig figs, you round your answer to .   Adding or subtracting? Line up your decimal points. Your answer should be rounded to the least precise decimal place from your inputs. For example, , which gets rounded to because is only precise to the tenths place.   Multiple Operations? Cast each spell in the proper order. Follow the standard order of operations (parentheses, exponents, multiplication\/division from left to right, then addition\/subtraction from left to right). Only round at the very end after all the magic is done. Do not round after each step. Rounding too early can throw your final result out of balance, like mimeasuring a potion halfway through.     Why Use Significant Figures?  Significant figures are like a secret code shared among scientists and magic folk alike. When you report a measurement of meters, you're really telling your fellow colleague: \"I'm confident about the and the , but the last digit (the ) could vary a bit.\" That message is embedded in the number's three-digit significant figure code, quietly revealing both precision and uncertainty.    Sig Figs and Scientific Notation  Scientific notation and significant figures are best friends. Writing a number like clearly shows that you've got three sig figs, no more, no less.  Here's how to combine them:    has sig figs    has sig figs   has sig fig  Each extra zero you intentionally include after the decimal adds more confidence to your measurement.    A Parting Word  With significant figures in your database, you can communicate your uncertainty across the vast realms of physics, chemistry, and cosmic measurement. Write your numbers with care, check your sig figs, and let no leading zero invade your notes.     Prep Questions: Significant Figures   Count the number of significant figures.

Through a combination of instructional video, explanatory text, and practice questions, you will become adept at all things units and dimensions.   Prep Videos: Units and Dimensions  Watch the following video(s) to get an introduction to units and dimensions.   Great Example of Interference     Prep Text: Units and Dimensions  Read the following text to learn about units and dimensions. Don't forget to try the checkpoint questions along the way!   Units   Units unit    Standardized quantities used to express and compare measurements. Each physical quantity has an associated unit that defines the scale of measurement. For example, the SI system uses the meter ( ) for length unit meter , the kilogram ( ) for mass unit kilogram , and the second ( ) for time unit second ; where meter, kilogram, and second are all base units.    Units are the steadfast way to seal your spells after casting. Units give your numbers meaning. The international system of units is called the SI system (from the French Système International d'Unités ). It defines seven base units , which form the foundation of all measurements in the magical realms of science include the seven SI base units: kilogram ( ), meter ( ), second ( ), mole ( ), ampere ( ), kelvin ( ), and candela ( ).    Dimensions   Dimensions dimensions    The fundamental classifications of physical quantities. A dimension specifies the physical nature of a quantity independently of the units used to measure it. Common dimension symbols include for length, for mass, and for time.    While units tell you how much of something you have, dimensions tell you what kind of thing it is. Dimensions are the elemental ingredients behind every physical quantity: mass , length , time , electric current , temperature , amount of substance , and luminous intensity .  Dimensions help you see through the illusion of numbers. For example, the dimension of length can be measured using many different units: meters, feet, centimeters, light-years, and so on. No matter which unit you choose, the underlying dimension, \"length\" is the true quantity being measured.    Using Units and Dimensions  Units and dimensions are powerful tools for checking whether your work makes sense. When you cast a spell (or perform a calculation), you can examine whether the units and\/or dimensions on both sides of the equation match. If they do, your spell is likely valid. If they don't, you may have miscalculated or miscast.  In your quest through physics, units and dimensions will act like your spellcraft syntax checker, quietly verifying your logic and guiding you toward equations that make physical sense. Be careful, though: if the dimensions or units do match, that only means the equation is dimensionally consistent. It doesn't guarantee the equation is correct or useful, just that it's dimensionally consistent.

They are not units.    Length, mass, and time are referred to as dimensions, or more specifically base dimensions.    No need to engage the computation core. This question is a databank lookup on dimensional protocols.       What are meter, kilogram, and second refered to as?    These are not dimensions.    Meter, kilogram, and second are referred to as SI units, or more specifically SI base units.    No need to unsheathe your scroll. This question is more of a quick lore check.

You can find the volume of this cube by multiplying the length by width by height. What are the base SI units for volume?           Correct!           Your targeting system glitched, try again. This is the dimensions of volume, but not the base SI units.           Your enchanted click missed the mark, try again. Volume is length multipled by width multiplied by height, this would be in the numerator, not the denominator.           Your digital blade missed the mark, try again. Volume is length multipled by width multiplied by height, this would be in the numerator, not the denominator. Also, this is notation for dimensions, not base SI units.          The mass density of an object is defined as the mass divided by the volume. What are the base SI units for mass density?           Correct!           Your targeting system glitched, try again. This is the dimensions of mass density, but not the base SI units.           Your enchanted click missed the mark, try again. Mass density is mass divided by volume; mass would be in the numerator and volume in the denominator. Also, this is notation for dimensions, not base SI units.           Your digital blade missed the mark, try again. Mass density is mass divided by volume; mass would be in the numerator and volume in the denominator.          The energy density of a system is defined as the energy divided by the volume. What are the base SI units for energy density?           Correct!           Your targeting system glitched, try again. Recall energy has base SI units of . Energy density is this divided by volume, which has base SI units of . What is ?           Your enchanted click missed the mark, try again. Recall energy has base SI units of . Energy density is this divided by volume, which has base SI units of .           Your digital blade missed the mark, try again. Oops, you have the energy in the denominator and volume in the numerator.          The current density in a material is defined as the electric current divided by the area the current is passing through. What are the base SI units for current density?           Correct!           Your targeting system glitched, try again. Recall current has base SI units of . Current density is this divided by area, which has base SI units of . What is compared to ?

Probability is a measure of the likelihood that a particular event will occur. Whether you're rolling dice, detecting particles, or predicting the path of a rogue comet, probability helps quantify uncertainty. The value of probability ranges from (impossible event) to (certain event). What are the dimensions of probability?      Dimensionless    Correct! Probability is a pure number with no dimensions. It represents a ratio or likelihood.           Your targeting system glitched, try again. Probability isn't tied to time. It doesn't describe a rate or frequency by itself.           Your enchanted click missed the mark, try again. This would describe a volume, not the likelihood of an outcome.           Your digital blade missed the mark, try again. This would describe some density in three-dimensional space, not the likelihood of an outcome.          In quantum mechanics, the probability density of an electron tells you how likely you are to find the electron in a particular region of space. Unlike probability itself, probability density spreads that likelihood out over a volume. What are the base dimensions of probability density?           Correct!

Through a combination of instructional video, explanatory text, and practice questions, you will become adept at all things unit prefixes.   Prep Videos: Units Prefixes  Watch the following video(s) to get an introduction to unit prefixes.   Great Example of Interference     Prep Text: Unit Prefixes  Read the following text to learn about unit prefixes. Don't forget to try the checkpoint questions along the way!   What Are Unit Prefixes?   Unit Prefix unit prefix    A modifier placed before a base unit to indicate a power-of-ten multiple or fraction of that unit. Unit prefixes provide a compact way to express very large or very small quantities. For example, the prefix kilo- means , so represents kilometers , or meters. Similarly, milli- means , so denotes milliseconds , or seconds.    Unit prefixes are the verbal runes that shrink or stretch your units with a single syllable. They're shortcuts to tame unwieldy measurements without changing their essence. Instead of writing out meters, you can invoke the prefix kilo- to conjure kilometers. Instead of whispering seconds, you can say nanosecond and sound like a seasoned chronomancer.  Prefixes are always attached to units, not to the raw numbers themselves. You won't hear \"nano\" on it's own; it always comes with a unit like \"meter\" or \"second.\" This is because prefixes are like magical modifiers that alter the scale of the unit, not the number itself.    Writing Prefixes and Their Symbols  If you want to use unit prefixes in your written spells, each prefix has its own symbol. For example, the prefix kilo- is represented by . A distance of  3   can be written more compactly as . Likewise, a time interval of  1   can be written as .   SI Unit Prefixes    Prefix Name  Symbol  Power of Ten  Decimal Name    quetta    nonillion    ronna    octillion    yotta    septillion    exa    quintillion    peta    quadrillion    tera    trillion    tera    trillion    giga    billion    mega    million    kilo    thousand    hecto    hundred    deca    ten    deci    tenth    centi    hundredth    milli    thousandth    micro    millionth    nano    billionth    pico    trillionth    femto    quadrillionth    atto    quintillionth    zepto    sextillionth    yocto    septillionth    ronto    octillionth    quecto    nonillionth     Note that there are also two ways to verbalize unit prefixes: the prefix name and the decimal name . The prefix name is the official SI term used in scientific contexts, like mega- or nano- . The decimal name is the everyday term that describes the quantity in more familiar terms, like \"million\" or \"billionth.\"      How would you say  73   in words?    The prefix is for mega, which means . The follows the prefix, and it stands for gram.     megagrams.    The prefix is for mega, which means . The follows the prefix, and it stands for gram. So  73   is megagrams. Or, if you prefer the decimal name, you could say million grams.       How would you say  22   in words?    nano is the prefix for , and the symbol for nano is .     nanoseconds.    nano is the prefix for , and the symbol for nano is . Seconds is the unit that follows the prefix nano. So  22   is nanoseconds. Or, if you prefer the decimal name, you could write billionths of a second.     Summary  You might wonder: if we can say “megagrams” instead of “a million grams,” why do we need both? The key is that they serve different roles in communication. The prefix name (like mega- ) is part of the official SI system. It's used when naming and writing units in scientific work: megameters, milliamps, nanoseconds. These are concise, precise, and standardized.  The decimal name (like “million”) isn't part of the unit itself, it's just how we describe the value of a number in everyday terms. You'll often hear it in speech, estimates, or media. Saying “a billion cells” or “a trillion dollars” is more natural for general audiences to understand compared to “gigacells” or “teradollars.”  So both ways are valid, but they're used in different contexts. And when you're fluent in both, you can navigate smoothly between scientific scrolls and everyday storytelling.  Bonus Trick: Poer of notation. When converting prefixed units to base units, you can use powers of ten to simplify the process. Each prefix corresponds to a specific power of ten. For example, turns into .    A Word of Caution  It's customary to not stack unit prefixes. For example, if you have million grams, you would not typically say kilokilogram, instead you would say megagrams or grams.  Be careful when communicating with synthetic beings, since unit prefixes used to represent different things in binary code. For example, kilobyte once used to be defined as bytes. However, those ancient scrolls have been updated to match our standard unit prefix notation. Now kilobyte is bytes, and kibibyte is bytes. It's best to extablish a common understanding before engaging in data transfer.

Through a combination of instructional video, explanatory text, and practice questions, you will become adept at all things unit conversions.   Prep Videos: Units Conversions  Watch the following video(s) to get an introduction to unit conversions.   Great Example of Interference     Prep Text: Unit Conversions  Read the following text to learn about unit conversions. Don't forget to try the checkpoint questions along the way!   Conversion Factors as Ratios of One   Unit Conversion unit conversion    Unit conversion is the process of expressing a quantity in a different unit system by multiplying it by one or more conversion factors. A conversion factor is a ratio of two equal quantities such as or , that has a numerical value of . Applying these ratios changes only the unit in which a quantity is expressed, not the quantity itself. Unit conversions let us translate measurements into the units most useful for a problem without altering their physical meaning.    You've measured the mass of a dragon's scale in ounces, but your spellbook demands grams. You're plotting a star map in light-years, but your onboard thrusters calculate in meters. What do you do?  You cast a unit conversion spell.  Unit conversions are the dimensional bridges that connect different lands of measurement. They don't change what you have, they simply describe it in a new tongue. Whether you're switching from meters to miles, hours to seconds, or joules to electronvolts, you're not summoning new quantities, you're just translating between dialects of the universal languages of science.  To convert between units, you multiply by a conversion factor which is a magical ratio equal to one.   Suppose a star cruiser travels at  90     . To express this in meters per second:     Both of the two conversion factors are fractions that equal one and stem from the following: and .  For example, start with the expression .  If you divide both sides by , you get .  Similarly, dividing both sides of by gives .  This tells us that multiplying any quantity by either of these fraction that equal is like casting a harmless illusion; it doesn't change the true value of a quantity, only the form in which it's expressed.  In other words, you're not altering reality, just viewing it through a different unit's lens.   It's like casting a chain of transmutation spells, each one carefully crafted so the old unit cancels and the new one takes its place. As long as your units behave, your math will too.    Common Conversions  While there's no universal conversion for all situations, below are some common conversions that will occur during the first part of of our journey through classical physics:    Length                    Mass            For derived dimensions like area or volume, you can use the above conversions or use the internet to search for a conversion.     Convert kilograms to pounds.    Use the conversion factor , which can be written as a fraction: .         To convert kilograms to pounds, multiply by the conversion factor:     Using the proper significant figures: kilograms is equal to pounds.       Convert to .     is the symbol for feet, and is the symbol for meters. Use the conversion factor , twice.         Note that our original unit is which can be written as .  So we need to multiply by the conversion between feet and meters twice:     ...or...     Using the proper significant figures: is equal to .      Purpose of Conversions  Humans, robots, magic folk, and aliens tend to use units that make sense in their context. When they want to communicate with each other, they need a way to convert thier measurement's unit to anothers preferred unit. For example, a human might measure the length of a dragon's tail in feet, while a robot might use meters. If they want to work together, they need to convert between these units.  Humans in different fields of study even use different units. For example, in physics, we often use the International System of Units (SI), which uses meters, kilograms, and seconds as its base units. While some engineers tend to use feet, slug, and seconds as their base units.    Fermi Problems  So you have made it this far, from scientific notation all the way to unit conversions, despite the curse placed upon you. Congratulations! Now, you can use your newfound skills to tackle Fermi problems.  A Fermi problem is a type of estimation problem that requires you to make reasonable assumptions and use unit conversions to arrive at an answer. Named after the physicist Enrico Fermi, these problems often involve estimating quantities that are difficult to measure directly, such as the number of jelly beans in a jar or the amount of energy consumed by a city in a day. The key is to break the problem down into smaller, manageable parts, make reasonable assumptions, and use unit conversions to arrive at an answer.  The answer to a Fermi problem is an estimate, not an exact value. Usually the answer is given in scientific notation with the order of magnitude being the most important part of the answer.       Fermi Problem: How much tea would it take to fill an airship's cargo bay?  Initial thought 1: The problem didn't specify the size of the airship's cargo bay, so we will estimate the size as a volume based on a typical commercial jet's passenger volume.    Height of the cargo bay.    The height of a typical commercial jet is tall enough for a person to stand up, so let's estimate about meters.        Width of the cargo bay.    The width of a typical commercial jet is wide enough for people to side shoulder to shoulder, and an aisle for person to walk through. So let's estimate the width of the jet to be about people widths. Since we are looking for an estimate, lets round up to people widths. A person is probably about meters wide, so the total width of the jet would be about .        Length of the cargo bay.    The length of a typical commercial jet is long enough for seats to fit in front of or behind each other. Let's estimate the length for each seat to be about the width of a person. Using meters as a person width again, that means the total length of the jet's passenger space is about .        Volume of cargo bay.    The volume is the product of the cargo bay's height, width, and length. So the total volume is about meters (height) times meters (width) times meters (length) cubic meters.      Initial thought 2: We now have the volume of the cargo bay in meters cubed, thus we also know much volume of tea we need in meters cubed: cubic meters.  While this is an answer, it might not be the most human friendly answer. In other words, do you immediately have a mental visual of how much cubic meters of tea is? Let's convert it to a more human friendly unit, cups. We will use cups since is reasonable to assume folks drink tea a cup at a time.    Cups of tea.    A quick internet search tells us that cubic meter is equal to cups. But remember, Fermi problems are about estimates, so we will round that to cups. Or in other words, cups.    So the total amount of tea needed to fill the airship's cargo bay is: .      That's . Or one million cups of tea. Enough to host a tea party for every elf in the eastern forest, twice.    A Parting Word  In general, when working on a project, if you start in SI units, and stay in SI units unless you have a solid reason (like a prophecy, or a stubborn client from another dimension).

Use unit conversions to express the time it takes for data to reach Earth. Keep the same unit of seconds, just add a prefix.    There are many options, but it's common to have the value between and when the original value has one sig fig. So your answer could be \"prefix\"seconds.     hectoseconds.    Rewrite seconds as seconds.  The prefix \"hecto\" means .  Therefore, seconds can be expressed as hectoseconds.  For fun: you can also say decaseconds, centiseconds, etc...   "
