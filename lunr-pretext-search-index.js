  "body": " Scientific Notation Prep    Prep Text: Scientific Notation  To wield scientific notation properly, follow these arcane guidelines:    Find the coefficient. Move the decimal point so the number becomes at least 1 but less than 10. This becomes the coefficient . For example, becomes .    Count the decimal steps. Count how many places you moved the decimal. That number becomes the exponent on your power of ten. If you moved the decimal to the left, the exponent is positive . If you moved it to the right, the exponent is negative .    Check your form. The final expression should look like , where and is an integer.      Convert to scientific notation.    The decimal point would need to move to the left by 4 places.       Move the decimal 4 places to the left: .      Convert to scientific notation.    The decimal point would need to move to the right by 5 places.       Move the decimal 5 places to the right: .    Why Use It?  Imagine trying to write the mass of the Earth (~ kg) or the mass of an electron (~ kg) without magical shorthand! Scientific notation saves parchment, keeps calculations neat, and makes comparison of large and small values easier.  Bonus Trick: Comparing Powers  Scientific notation reveals orders of magnitude . Two numbers differ by one order of magnitude for every tenfold difference. A dragon's hoard of gold coins is three orders of magnitude larger than a goblin's pouch of .  A Final Word from the Grand Mathemagician  With scientific notation in your spellbook, you can navigate the vast realms of physics, chemistry, and cosmic measurement. Write your numbers with care, check your powers of ten, and let no zero go unwielded.    Prep Questions: Scientific Notation   Convert standard notation to scientific notation.
