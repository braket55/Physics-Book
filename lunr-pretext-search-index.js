  "body": " Prep    Prep Text: Scientific Notation   To wield scientific notation properly, follow these arcane guidelines:      Find the coefficient. Move the decimal point so the number becomes at least 1 but less than 10. This becomes the coefficient . For example, 32,700 becomes \"3.27\".     Count the decimal steps. Count how many places you moved the decimal. That number becomes the exponent on your power of ten. If you moved the decimal to the left, the exponent is positive . If you moved it to the right, the exponent is negative .     Check your form. The final expression should look like , where and is an integer.       Convert 32,700 to scientific notation.    The decimal point would need to move to the left by 4 places.         To write 32,700 in scientific notation, move the decimal point four places to the left to place it after the first nonzero digit. This gives \"3.27\". Since the decimal moved left by four places, the exponent on 10 is 4.  So, .       Convert 0.0000089 to scientific notation.    The decimal point would need to move to the right by 6 places.         To write 0.0000089 in scientific notation, move the decimal point six places to the right to place it after the first nonzero digit. This gives \"8.9\". Because the decimal moved right by six places, the exponent on 10 is -6.  So, .     Why Use It?   Imagine trying to write the mass of the Earth (~ kg) or the mass of an electron (~ kg) without magical shorthand! Scientific notation saves parchment, keeps calculations neat, and makes comparison of large and small values easier.   Bonus Trick: Comparing Powers   Scientific notation reveals orders of magnitude . Two numbers differ by one order of magnitude for every tenfold difference. A dragon's hoard of gold coins is three orders of magnitude larger than a goblin's pouch of .   A Parting Word   With scientific notation in your spellbook, you can navigate the vast realms of physics, chemistry, and cosmic measurement. Write your numbers with care, check your powers of ten, and let no zero go unwielded.    Prep Questions: Scientific Notation    Convert standard notation to scientific notation.      Convert 0.0072 to scientific notation.           Correct!            Your targeting system glitched, try again. While , the coefficient must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10 for scientific notation.           Your enchanted click missed the mark, try again. The decimal moved left, so the power should be negative.           Your digital blade missed the mark, try again. 0.0072 is smaller than 0.072.         Convert to scientific notation.           Correct!            Your targeting system glitched, try again. You left out a digit—don't forget the 2.           Your enchanted click missed the mark, try again.

Convert 0.000000099 to scientific notation.    The decimal point would need to move to the right by 8 places.         To write 0.000000099 in scientific notation, move the decimal point eight places to the right to place it after the first nonzero digit. This gives \"9.9\". Since the decimal moved right by eight places, the exponent on 10 is -8.  So, .        A strand of human hair is about 0.00007 meters in diameter. Convert 0.00007 to scientific notation.    The decimal point would need to move to the right by 5 places.         To write 0.00007 in scientific notation, move the decimal point five places to the right to place it after the first nonzero digit. This gives \"7.0\". Since the decimal moved right by five places, the exponent on 10 is -5.  So, .        A grain of sand can be about 0.0012 meters in diameter. Convert 0.0012 to scientific notation.    The decimal point would need to move to the right by 3 places.         To write 0.0012 in scientific notation, move the decimal point three places to the right to place it after the first nonzero digit. This gives \"1.2\". Since the decimal moved right by three places, the exponent on 10 is -3.  So, .        An average adult human might be about 1.75 meters tall. Convert 1.75 to scientific notation.    The decimal point would need to move to the left by 0 places.         To write 1.75 in scientific notation, the decimal is already after the first nonzero digit, so we don’t need to move it. That means the exponent on 10 is 0.  So, .        The Empire State Building in New York City is about meters tall. Convert to standard notation.    A positive exponent means move the decimal to the right. Move it 2 places to the right.    381     means move the decimal point 2 places to the right: .  So, .        Mount Everest is approximately meters tall. Convert to standard notation.    Move the decimal point 3 places to the right.    8850     means move the decimal 3 places to the right: .  So, .        The Earth's diameter is about meters. Convert to standard notation.    Move the decimal 7 places to the right.    12,700,000     means move the decimal 7 places to the right: .  So, .        The average distance from Earth to the Sun is about meters. Convert to standard notation.    Move the decimal 11 places to the right.    149,600,000,000     means move the decimal 11 places to the right: .  So, .        About how many orders of magnitude larger is a human compared to a grain of sand? Use questions and to help.     Compare the exponents: vs. . How many powers of ten apart are they?    3    The exponent for the human's height is 0, and for the grain of sand it is -3. The difference is .  So, a human is approximately 3 orders of magnitude larger than a grain of sand. This means the human is about times taller than the grain of sand.  In other words, if you stacked 1,000 grains of sand end to end, they would reach about the height of one person!        About how many orders of magnitude larger is a human compared to an influenza virus? Use questions and to help.     Compare the exponents: vs. . How many powers of ten apart are they?    8    The exponent for the human's height is 0, and for the virus it is -8. The difference is .  So, a human is approximately 8 orders of magnitude larger than the influenza virus. This means the human is about times taller than the virus.  In other words, if you stacked 100,000,000 viruses end to end, they would reach about the height of one person!      "
