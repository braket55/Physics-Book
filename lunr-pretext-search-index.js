  "body": " Prep    Prep Text: Scientific Notation   To wield scientific notation properly, follow these arcane guidelines:      Find the coefficient. Move the decimal point so the number becomes at least 1 but less than 10. This becomes the coefficient . For example, 32,700 becomes \"3.27\".     Count the decimal steps. Count how many places you moved the decimal. That number becomes the exponent on your power of ten. If you moved the decimal to the left, the exponent is positive . If you moved it to the right, the exponent is negative .     Check your form. The final expression should look like , where and is an integer.       Convert 32,700 to scientific notation.    The decimal point would need to move to the left by 4 places.         To write 32,700 in scientific notation, move the decimal point four places to the left to place it after the first nonzero digit. This gives \"3.27\". Since the decimal moved left by four places, the exponent on 10 is 4.  So, .       Convert 0.0000089 to scientific notation.    The decimal point would need to move to the right by 6 places.         To write 0.0000089 in scientific notation, move the decimal point six places to the right to place it after the first nonzero digit. This gives \"8.9\". Because the decimal moved right by six places, the exponent on 10 is -6.  So, .     Why Use It?   Imagine trying to write the mass of the Earth (~ kg) or the mass of an electron (~ kg) without magical shorthand! Scientific notation saves parchment, keeps calculations neat, and makes comparison of large and small values easier.   Bonus Trick: Comparing Powers   Scientific notation reveals orders of magnitude . Two numbers differ by one order of magnitude for every tenfold difference. A dragon's hoard of gold coins is about three orders of magnitude larger than a goblin's pouch of . 3 was obtained by subtracting the exponents (6 - 3 = 3).  Likewise, a nanobot's processor that uses joules per operation is about two orders of magnitude smaller than a clunky space probe core drawing joules per operation. 2 was obtained by subtracting the exponents (-9 - (-7) = -2).   A Parting Word   With scientific notation in your spellbook, you can navigate the vast realms of physics, chemistry, and cosmic measurement. Write your numbers with care, check your powers of ten, and let no zero go unwielded.    Prep Questions: Scientific Notation    Convert standard notation to scientific notation.

  "body": " Prep    Prep Text: Significant Figures  Significant figures (or sig figs ) are the trustworthy digits in a measurementâ€”those that carry real meaning. They help ensure precision and honesty in your scientific spells and calculations. To wield them wisely, follow these rules:    Start with what you see. All non-zero digits are significant. If your magic crystal reads 3.472 volts, that's four significant figuresâ€”each non-zero digit counts.   Zeroes have secrets.   Zeroes between non-zero digits are always significant. Example: 101 has three sig figs.  Leading zeroes (before any non-zero digits) are just placeholdersâ€”they don't count. Example: 0.0035 has two sig figs.  Trailing zeroes (after the decimal point) do count! Example: 2.300 has four sig figs.  Trailing zeroes in a whole number without a decimal? Mysterious! They may not be significant unless written in scientific notation. Example: 1500 could have two, three, or four sig figsâ€”but definitely has four. To help clarify our communication in this guide, we will treat 1500 as two sig figs and as three sig figs.     Rounding  To round properly, follow these enchanted guidelines:   If digit to the right of your last desired digit is 6, 7, 8 or 9 then round the last desired digit up by one. Example: 2.46 â†’ 2.5 (if keeping two sig figs)  If digit to the right of your last desired digit is 4, 3, 2, or 0 then keep the desired digit unchanged. Example: 2.14 â†’ 2.1 (if keeping two sig figs)  If digit to the right of your last desired digit is 5 and there are other non-zero digits to the right of that 5, then round the last desired digit up by one. Example: 2.2501 â†’ 2.3 (if keeping two sig figs)  If digit to the right of your last desired digit is 5 and there is no other non-zero digits to the right of that 5, then round to the nearest even digit. Example: 2.250 â†’ 2.2 (if keeping two sig figs). Example: 2.35 â†’ 2.4 (if keeping two sig figs).     Math with Care  When combining numbers in your calculations, the significant figures must follow the rules of magical balance:    Multiplying or dividing? Your answer should have the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest. For example, , but since has only two sig figs, you round your answer to .   Adding or subtracting? Line up your decimal points. Your answer should be rounded to the least precise decimal place from your inputs. For example, , which gets rounded to because is only precise to the tenths place.   Multiple Operations Cast each spell in the proper order! Follow the standard order of operations (parentheses, exponents, multiplication\/division from left to right, then addition\/subtraction from left to right)., Only round at the very endâ€”after all the magic is done. Do not round after each step. Rounding too early can throw your final result out of balance, like miscasting a potion halfway through.        How many significant figures are in the number: 42.02?    All non-zero digits count. Also, zeros between non-zero digits count.    42.02 has four significant figures.    42.02 has three non-zero digits: 4, 2, and 2. This counts as three significant figures so far. There is also a zero between two of the non-zero digits, which counts as a fourth significant figure.  So, 42.02 has four significant figures.       How many significant figures are in the number: 0.007?    All non-zero digits count. Leading zeros (zeros that occur to the left of the first non-zero digit) don't count.    0.007 has one significant figure.    0.007 has one non-zero digit: 7. This counts as one significant figures so far. There is also zeros, but all the zeros occur to the left of the 7 and are not between non-zero digits, so the zeros do not count.  So, 0.007 has one significant figure.     Why Use It?   Significant figures are like a secret code shared among scientists and magic folk alike. When you report a measurement of 1.27 meters, you're really telling your fellow colleague: \"I'm confident about the 1 and the 2, but the last digitâ€”the 7â€”could vary a bit.\" That message is embedded in the number's three-digit significant figure code, quietly revealing both precision and uncertainty.   Bonus Trick: Using Sig Figs in Scientific Notation   Scientific notation and significant figures are best friends. Writing a number like clearly shows that you've got three sig figsâ€”no more, no less.  Here's how to combine their powers:    â†’ 2 sig figs    â†’ 3 sig figs   â†’ 1 sig fig  Each extra zero you intentionally include after the decimal adds more confidence to your measurement.   A Parting Word   With significant figures in your database, you can communicate your uncertainty across the vast realms of physics, chemistry, and cosmic measurement. Write your numbers with care, check your sig figs, and let no leading zero invade your notes.    Prep Questions: Significant Figures    Count the number of significant figures.

This worksheet is designed to help you explore the concept of significant figures in physics.         It take the Moon about 27.3 days to orbit Earth. How many significant figures are in this measurement?    Non-zero digits are always significant.    Three    27.3 has three non-zero digits: 2, 7, and 3. This counts as three significant figures.  So, 27.3 has three significant figures.        The mean diameter of the Moon is about 3,475,000 meters. How many significant figures are in this measurement?    All non-zero digits are significant. Leading zeros are not significant. Trailing zeros in a whole number without a decimal point are not significant.    Four    3,475,000 has four non-zero digits: 3, 4, 7, and 5. The trailing zeros after the 5 are not significant because there is no decimal point or underline.  So, 3,475,000 has four significant figures.        The mass of the Moon is about kilograms. How many significant figures are in this measurement?    All non-zero digits are significant. Zeros between non-zero digits are significant. Trailing zeros after a decimal point are significant.    Five     has four non-zero digits: 7, 3, 4, and 6. The zero occurs after a decimal so it is also significant.  So, has five significant figures.        The mean diameter of the Moon is about 3,475,000 meters. Since the Moon is roughly spherical, we can calculate its volume using the formula: , where is the radius. Calculate the volume of the Moon and express your answer in scientific notation with the correct number of significant figures.    The 4 and 3 in the fraction are exact numbers, so they do not affect the number of significant figures. The radius is half the diameter, so meters. The given diameter has four significant figures, and we are multiplying it by itself three times in the volume formula, so the final answer should also have four significant figures.     , where is the symbol for meters.     . Do not round yet, as we will keep all significant figures until the end.   .   .   .  Our original value of the diameter has four sig figs, and we are muliplying itself three time in the volume equaiton. So our volume should have four sig figs. .  Then the volume of the Moon is, , where is the symbol for meters.        The mass of the Moon is about kilograms. The volume of the Moon is about, . The mass density of the Moon can be calculated using the formula: , where is the mass and is the volume. Calculate the mean density of the Moon and express your answer in scientific notation with the correct number of significant figures.    The mass has five significant figures, and the volume has four significant figures.    3344     Let mass be represented by the sombol . So kilograms.  Let volume be represented by the sombol . So .  Mass density \" \" is given by the formula: .   .   .   .  The original mass has five significant figures, and the volume has four significant figures. The final answer should have the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest significant figures, which is four.  So the mean density of the Moon is .        When an object falls near the surface of the Earth, ignoring air resistance, the object will have an acceleration of about 9.80 , where is the symbol for meters and is the symbol for seconds. When an object falls near the surface of the Moon, the object will have an acceleration of about 1.622 . Calculate the absolute value of the difference between the surface acceleration on the Moon and the surface acceleration on Earth.    Difference is calculated by subtracting the two values. The surface acceleration on the Moon has four significant figures, and the surface acceleration on Earth has three significant figures.    8.18 .    The difference between the surface acceleration on the Moon and the surface acceleration on Earth is calculated by subtracting the two values:   . Note that the question didn't specify which value to subtract from which, so we can choose either order. If you subtract the surface acceleration on the Moon from the surface acceleration on Earth, you will get a positive value.  The absolute value of the difference is .  The surface acceleration on the Moon has four significant figures, and the surface acceleration on Earth has three significant figures. The final answer should have the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest significant figures, which is three.  So the absolute value of the difference between the surface acceleration on the Moon and the surface acceleration on Earth is 8.18 .      "

The international system of units is called the SI system (from the French SystÃ¨me International d'UnitÃ©s ). It defines seven base units , which form the foundation of all measurements in the magical realms of science: kilogram (kg), meter (m), second (s), mole (mol), ampere (A), kelvin (K), and candela (cd).   Dimensions   While units tell you how much of something you have, dimensions tell you what kind of thing it is. Dimensions are the elemental ingredients behind every physical quantity: mass [M], length [L], time [T], electric current [I], temperature [Î˜], amount of substance [n], and luminous intensity [J].  Dimensions help you see through the illusion of numbers. For example, the dimension of length can be measured using many different units: meters, feet, centimeters, light-years, and so on. No matter which unit you choose, the underlying dimensionâ€”lengthâ€”is the true quantity being measured.   Units and Dimensions   Units and dimensions are powerful tools for checking whether your work makes sense. When you cast a spell (or perform a calculation), you can examine whether the units and\/or dimensions on both sides of the equation match. If they do, your spell is likely valid. If they don't, you may have miscalculated or miscast.  In your quest through physics, units and dimensions will act like your spellcraft syntax checker, quietly verifying your logic and guiding you toward equations that make physical sense. Be careful, though: if the dimensions or units do match, that only means the equation is dimensionally consistent. It doesn't guarantee the equation is correct or useful, just that it's dimensionally consistent.

They are not units.    Length, mass, and time are referred to as dimensions, or more specifically base dimensions.    No need to engage the computation core. This question is a databank lookup on dimensional protocols.       What are meter, kilogram, and second refered to as?    These are not dimensions.    Meter, kilogram, and second are referred to as units, or more specifically base units or even SI units.    No need to unsheathe your scroll. This question is more of a quick lore check.     Why Use Them?   A number without clearly labeled units is just a riddle. And while riddles can be fun, we're dealing with science, magic, and pressing matters that demand clear communication.   Bonus Trick: How do we define units and dimensions?   A wonderful location to dig deeper into units and dimensions is at the National Institude of Standards and Technology (NIST).  Looking for a quick refresher on SI units? Try SI Units .  Want to dig a little deeper and learn how each SI unit is defined experimentally and some historical context? Check out NIST: Definitions of the SI Base Units .   A Parting Word   With units in your toolkit and dimensions as your compass, you're ready to navigate the equations of the universe.

This worksheet is designed to help you explore the concept of units and dimensions in physics.         The quantity position has the following dimensions: . Position is a measure of how far and in what direction an object is from a reference point. What is the SI unit of position?    [L] stands for length.]    m, where m is the symbol for meters.    Replace [L] with the SI unit symbol for length, m.  So, the SI unit of position is m, where m is the symbol for meters.        The quantity velocity has the following dimensions: . Velocity is a measure of how fast an object is moving and in what direction. What is the SI unit of velocity?    [L] stands for length, and [T] stands for time. Also, the exponent -1 means that the unit for time is in the denominator (i.e. )    m\/s, where m is the symbol for meters and s is the symbol for seconds.    Replace [L] with the SI unit for length, which is m, and [T] with the SI unit for time, which is s.  The unit becomes , which is meters per second.        The quantity acceleration has the following dimensions: . Acceleration is a measure of how quickly an object changes its velocity and in what direction. What is the SI unit of acceleration?    [L] stands for length, and [T] stands for time. Also, the exponent -2 means that the unit for time is in the denominator (i.e. )    m\/sÂ², where m is the symbol for meters and s is the symbol for seconds.    Replace [L] with m and [T] with s.  The unit becomes , which is meters per second squared.        The quantity force has the following dimensions: . Force is a measure of how hard and in what direction an object pushs or pulls on another object. What is the SI unit of force?    [M] stands for mass, [L] for length, and [T] for time. Also, the exponent -2 means that the unit for time is in the denominator (i.e. )    kgÂ·m\/sÂ², where kg is the symbol for kilogram, m is the symbol for meter, and s is the symbol for second.    Replace [M] with kg, [L] with m, and [T] with s.  The unit becomes , which is kilogram multipled by meter per second.        The quantity energy has the following SI units: . Energy can't be summarized by a simple sentence. However, it's related to many things in our everyday lives, such as the energy stored in food that our body needs to function, the energy stored in batteries that our electronic devices need to function, and even energy stored in the vacuum of space itself!

Your digital blade missed the mark, try again. Mass density is mass divided by volume; mass would be in the numerator and volume in the denominator.          The energy density of a system is defined as the energy divided by the volume. What are the base SI units for energy density?           Correct!           Your targeting system glitched, try again. Recall energy has base SI units of . Energy density is this divided by volume, which has base SI units of . What is ?           Your enchanted click missed the mark, try again. Recall energy has base SI units of . Energy density is this divided by volume, which has base SI units of .           Your digital blade missed the mark, try again. Oops, you have the energy in the denominator and volume in the numerator.

Probability is a measure of the likelihood that a particular event will occur. Whether you're rolling dice, detecting particles, or predicting the path of a rogue comet, probability helps quantify uncertainty. The value of probability ranges from 0 (impossible event) to 1 (certain event). What are the dimensions of probability?      Dimensionless    Correct! Probability is a pure number with no dimensions. It represents a ratio or likelihood.           Your targeting system glitched, try again. Probability isn't tied to time. It doesn't describe a rate or frequency by itself.           Your enchanted click missed the mark, try again. This would describe a volume, not the likelihood of an outcome.           Your digital blade missed the mark, try again. You're technically correct in notation, but the better answer is to call it \"dimensionless.\"          In quantum mechanics, the probability density of an electron tells you how likely you are to find the electron in a particular region of space. Unlike probability itself, probability density spreads that likelihood out over a volume. What are the base dimensions of probability density?           Correct! Probability density represents probability per unit volume.           Your targeting system glitched, try again. This would represent a volume, not a density that spreads probability through space.      Dimensionless    Your enchanted click missed the mark, try again. While total probability is dimensionless, the density must compensate for the volume it's distributed across.           Your digital blade missed the mark, try again. Time doesn't play a direct role in the dimensionality of spatial probability density.       "
