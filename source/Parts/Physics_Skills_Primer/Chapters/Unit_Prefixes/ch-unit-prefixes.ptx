        <p>
            Once you've labeled your numbers with proper units, there's still one more charm to simplify your incantation: <em>unit prefixes</em>.
            Instead of casting a long spell like <m>3.7 \times 10^3</m> meters, you can simply say 3.7 kilometers: same magic, less chanting.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unit prefixes are like verbal shortcuts for your measurements: just a word, and your notation becomes neater, quicker, and easier to wield.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                A “kilo-” means a thousand (<m>10^3</m>), so instead of saying 3,000 meters, you can simply say 3 kilometers.
            </li>

            <li>
                A “nano-” means one-billionth (<m>10^{-9}</m>), which might be perfect for producing electrical parts while building your robot.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Whether you're measuring the mass of a star (quettagrams) or the charge on a single electron (attocoulombs), unit prefixes help you speak the right language clearly and concisely.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mastering prefixes means your scientific spells are never too long, never too vague, but just the right length for whatever tricky situation you find yourself in.
