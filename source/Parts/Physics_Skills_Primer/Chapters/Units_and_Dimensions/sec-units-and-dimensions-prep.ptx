        <p>
            Standardized quantities used to express and compare measurements.
            Each physical quantity has an associated unit that defines the scale of measurement.
            For example, the SI system uses the meter (<m>\text{m}</m>) for length
            <idx><main>unit</main><sub>meter</sub></idx>,
            the kilogram (<m>\text{kg}</m>) for mass
            <idx><main>unit</main><sub>kilogram</sub></idx>,
            and the second (<m>\text{s}</m>) for time
            <idx><main>unit</main><sub>second</sub></idx>;
            where meter, kilogram, and second are all base units.
        </p>
        </meaning>
      </definition>

      <p>
        Units are the steadfast way to seal your spells after casting.
        Units give your numbers meaning.
        The international system of units is called the SI system (from the French <em>Système International d'Unités</em>).
        It defines seven base units <xref ref="subsec-prep-units-dims-table"/>, which form the foundation of all measurements in the magical realms of science include the seven SI base units: kilogram (<m>\text{kg}</m>), meter (<m>\text{m}</m>), second (<m>\text{s}</m>), mole (<m>\text{mol}</m>), ampere (<m>\text{A}</m>), kelvin (<m>\text{K}</m>), and candela (<m>\text{cd}</m>).

        </term> <meaning>

        <p>
          The fundamental classifications of physical quantities.
          A dimension specifies the physical nature of a quantity independently of the units used to measure it.
          Common dimension symbols include <m>[L]</m> for length, <m>[M]</m> for mass, and <m>[T]</m> for time.
        </p>
        </meaning>
      </definition>

      <p>
        While units tell you how much of something you have, dimensions tell you what kind of thing it is.
        Dimensions <xref ref="subsec-prep-units-dims-table"/> are the elemental ingredients behind every physical quantity: mass <m>[M]</m>, length <m>[L]</m>, time <m>[T]</m>, electric current <m>[I]</m>, temperature <m>[\Theta]</m>, amount of substance <m>[n]</m>, and luminous intensity <m>[J]</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dimensions help you see through the illusion of numbers.
        For example, the dimension of length can be measured using many different units: meters, feet, centimeters, light-years, and so on.
        No matter which unit you choose, the underlying dimension, "length" is the true quantity being measured.

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsec-prep-units-and-dims">
      <title>Using Units and Dimensions</title>

      <p>
        Units and dimensions are powerful tools for checking whether your work makes sense.
        When you cast a spell (or perform a calculation), you can examine whether the units and/or dimensions on both sides of the equation match.
        If they do, your spell is likely valid.
        If they don't, you may have miscalculated or miscast.
      </p>

      <p>
        In your quest through physics, units and dimensions will act like your spellcraft syntax checker, quietly verifying your logic and guiding you toward equations that make physical sense.
        Be careful, though: if the dimensions or units do match, that only means the equation is dimensionally consistent.
        It doesn't guarantee the equation is correct or useful, just that it's dimensionally consistent.
