                    <p>
                        The quantity <em>electric charge</em> has SI units of <m>\text{A·s}</m>.
                        Charge is a fundamental property of matter that governs how particles respond to electromagnetic fields and how they produce those fields themselves.
                        Every lightning bolt, every battery, and every cat rubbing against a sweater has charge involved.
                        What is the base dimensions of electric charge?

                </statement>

                <hint>
                    <p>
                        Look at the units: <m>text{A}</m> (ampere) is electric current, and <m>\text{s}</m> (second) is time.
                    </p>
                </hint>

                <answer>
                    <p>
                        <m>[I][T]</m>
                    </p>
                </answer>

                <solution>
                    <p>
                        From the units <m>\text{A·s}</m>, we identify:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <m>\text{A}</m> is replaced with <m>[I]</m>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <m>\text{s}</m> is replaced with <m>[T]</m>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        So, the base dimensions of charge are <m>[I][T]</m>.
