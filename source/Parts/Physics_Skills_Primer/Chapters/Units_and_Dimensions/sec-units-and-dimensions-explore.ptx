                <solution>
                    <p>
                        From the units <m>A \cdot s</m>, we identify:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A → <m>[I]</m>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            S → <m>[T]</m>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        So, the base dimensions of charge are <m>[I][T]</m>.
