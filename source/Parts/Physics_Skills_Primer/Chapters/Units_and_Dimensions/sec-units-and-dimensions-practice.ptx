                    Consider a cube.
                    Perhaps a magical or a glowing futuristic cube.
                    You can find the volume of this cube by multiplying the length by width by height.
                    What are the base SI units for volume?

                    Probability is a measure of the likelihood that a particular event will occur.
                    Whether you're rolling dice, detecting particles, or predicting the path of a rogue comet, probability helps quantify uncertainty.
                    The value of probability ranges from 0 (impossible event) to 1 (certain event).
                    What are the dimensions of probability?

                            Probability isn't tied to time.
                            It doesn't describe a rate or frequency by itself.

                            You're technically correct in notation, but the better answer is to call it "dimensionless."

                    In quantum mechanics, the <em>probability density</em> of an electron tells you how likely you are to find the electron in a particular region of space.
                    Unlike probability itself, probability density spreads that likelihood out over a volume.
                    What are the base dimensions of probability density?

                            While total probability is dimensionless, the <em>density</em> must compensate for the volume it's distributed across.
