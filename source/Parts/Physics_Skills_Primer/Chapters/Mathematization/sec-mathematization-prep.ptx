        <title>Prep Text: Mathematization</title>

        <p>
            This is the main introduction to the topic.
        </p>

        <p>
            Esentially a mini textbook.
        </p>

        <p>
            Doesn't need to be extremely thorough for the first pass through.
            You can edit it later during a 2nd round of edits.
        </p>

        <p>
            I try to aim for about 0-1 example problems at this point after the introduction for any involved calculations.
            Example problems have a single drop down with the statement and solution all containted within the drop down.
        </p>
        <!-- Example Question 01 --> <!-- Quick intro -->
        <example xml:id ="subsec-prep-mathematization-text-example-01">
            <p>
                This is a the first example problem example.
                This is a good spot for a question.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is the begining of the solution.
            </p>

            <p>
                Include as many paragraphs as needed.
                You can include math stuff too.
            </p>
        </example>

        <p>
            Maybe a short debreif after the examples?
        </p>

        <p>
            I also like to have 1-3 check point questions after the examples if any.
            The check point questions have a dropdown that shows the question, then there are three more drop downs for hints, answer, and solution.

        <p>
            This is a why section.
            Not sure if I will always have this since I try to motivate the topic throughout.
            But keep this short, very short if included.

            <term>Bonus Trick: something fun</term>

        <p>
            Is this topic related to something else fun, if so mention it here.
        </p>

        <p>
            Keep it short.

        <p>
            If the bonus trick needs a longer example, include it after here.

            These questions have a drop down for the problem statement, then have multiple choice options.
            Each option has a hint after clicked and checked by user.
