        <p>
            Suppose you've just measured the length of a wyvern's wingspan in meters, but your potion recipe calls for inches.
            Fear not.
            All you need is to cast a unit conversion spell.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unit conversions let you pass between unit realms, preserving both the quantity and the dimension it belongs to.
        </p>

        <p>
            To convert a unit, you multiply it by a cleverly chosen form of one: a conversion factor which is a ratio that equals the value of one.
            These enchanted ratios are built from equal quantities written in different units, like <m>1 \text{ inch} = 2.54 \text{ cm}</m>.
            Use them wisely, and you can reshape any unit into the a different unit your quest requires.
        </p>

        <p>
            With this skill in your spellbook, you'll never be caught off guard when moving between units.
