        <p>
          The digits in a measured or calculated value that convey meaningful precision.
          Significant figures include all certain digits and the first uncertain digit.

      <p>
        Significant figures (or <em>sig figs</em>) are the trustworthy digits in a measurement.
        They help ensure precision and honesty in your scientific spells and calculations.

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsec-prep-sf-counting">
      <title>Counting Significant Figures</title>

      <p>
        To wield them wisely, follow these rules:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Start with what you see.
          All <em>non-zero digits</em> are significant.
          If your magic crystal reads <m>3.472</m> volts, that's four significant figures; each non-zero digit counts.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Zeroes have secrets.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Zeroes <em>between</em> non-zero digits are always significant.
              Example: <m>101</m> has three sig figs.
            </li>

            <li>
              Leading zeroes (before any non-zero digits) are just placeholders; they don't count.
              Example: <m>0.0035</m> has two sig figs.
            </li>

            <li>
              Trailing zeroes (after the decimal point) <em>do</em> count! Example: <m>2.300</m> has four sig figs.
            </li>

            <li>
              Trailing zeroes in a whole number without a decimal? Mysterious! They may not be significant unless written in scientific notation.
              Example: <m>1500</m> could have two, three, or four sig figs, but <m>1.500 \times 10^3</m> definitely has four.
              To help clarify our communication in this guide, we will treat <m>1500</m> as two sig figs and <m>15\underline{0}0</m> as three sig figs.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

            <m>42.02</m> has four significant figures.
          </p>
        </answer>

        <solution>
          <p>
            <m>42.02</m> has three non-zero digits: <m>4</m>, <m>2</m>, and <m>2</m>. This counts as three significant figures so far. There is also a zero between two of the non-zero digits, which counts as a fourth significant figure.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, <m>42.02</m> has four significant figures.

        <solution>
          <p>
            <m>0.007</m> has one non-zero digit: <m>7</m>. This counts as one significant figures so far. There is also zeros, but all the zeros occur to the left of the <m>7</m> and are not between non-zero digits, so the zeros do not count.

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsec-prep-sf-rounding">
      <title>Rounding with Significant Figures</title>

      <p>
        To round properly, follow these enchanted guidelines:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          If digit to the right of your last desired digit is <m>6, 7, 8, 9</m> then round the last desired digit up by one.
          Example: <m>2.46 \rightarrow 2.5</m> (if keeping two sig figs).
        </li>

        <li>
          If digit to the right of your last desired digit is <m>4, 3, 2, 1, or 0</m> then keep the desired digit unchanged.
          Example: <m>2.14 \rightarrow 2.1</m> (if keeping two sig figs)
        </li>

        <li>
          If digit to the right of your last desired digit is <m>5</m> and there are other non-zero digits to the right of that <m>5</m>, then round the last desired digit up by one.
          Example: <m>2.2501 \rightarrow 2.3</m> (if keeping two sig figs)
        </li>

        <li>
          If digit to the right of your last desired digit is <m>5</m> and there is no other non-zero digits to the right of that <m>5</m>, then round to the nearest even digit.
          Example: <m>2.250 \rightarrow 2.2</m> (if keeping two sig figs).
          Example: <m>2.35 \rightarrow 2.4</m> (if keeping two sig figs).
        </li>
      </ol>
    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsec-prep-sf-calculations">
      <title>Using Sig Figs in Calculations</title>

      <p>
        When combining numbers in your calculations, the significant figures must follow the rules of magical balance:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>Multiplying or dividing?</em> Your answer should have the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the fewest. For example, <m>2.5 \times 3.42 = 8.55</m>, but since <m>2.5</m> has only two sig figs, you round your answer to <m>8.6</m>.
        </li>

        <li>
          <em>Adding or subtracting?</em> Line up your decimal points. Your answer should be rounded to the least precise decimal place from your inputs. For example, <m>12.11 + 3.6 = 15.71</m>, which gets rounded to <m>15.7</m> because <m>3.6</m> is only precise to the tenths place.
        </li>

        <li>
          <em>Multiple Operations?</em> Cast each spell in the proper order. Follow the standard order of operations (parentheses, exponents, multiplication/division from left to right, then addition/subtraction from left to right). Only round at the very end after all the magic is done. Do not round after each step. Rounding too early can throw your final result out of balance, like mimeasuring a potion halfway through.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsec-prep-sf-why">
      <title>Why Use Significant Figures?</title>

      <p>
        Significant figures are like a secret code shared among scientists and magic folk alike.
        When you report a measurement of <m>1.27</m> meters, you're really telling your fellow colleague: "I'm confident about the <m>1</m> and the <m>2</m>, but the last digit (the <m>7</m>) could vary a bit." That message is embedded in the number's three-digit significant figure code, quietly revealing both precision and uncertainty.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsec-prep-sf-sci-notation">
      <title>Sig Figs and Scientific Notation</title>

      <p>
        Scientific notation and significant figures are best friends.
        Writing a number like <m>6.02 \times 10^{23}</m> clearly shows that you've got three sig figs, no more, no less.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's how to combine them:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>3.0 \times 10^2</m> has <m>2</m> sig figs
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <m>3.00 \times 10^2</m> has <m>3</m> sig figs
          </li>

          <li>
            <m>3 \times 10^2</m> has <m>1</m> sig fig
          </li>
        </ul>
        Each extra zero you <em>intentionally</em> include after the decimal adds more confidence to your measurement.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsec-prep-sf-parting">
      <title>A Parting Word</title>

      <p>
        With significant figures in your database, you can communicate your uncertainty across the vast realms of physics, chemistry, and cosmic measurement.
        Write your numbers with care, check your sig figs, and let no leading zero invade your notes.

            <m>81.201 - 3.02 = 78.181</m> When adding or subtracting, your answer should be rounded to the same number of decimal places as the measurement with the fewest decimal places. <m>81.201</m> has three decimal places, and <m>3.02</m> has two decimal places.
