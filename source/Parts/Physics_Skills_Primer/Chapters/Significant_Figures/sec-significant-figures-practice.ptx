        <!-- Practice Question 01 --> <!-- Escape velocity of Earth and Moon -->
        <exercise xml:id ="practice-sig-figs-01">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    If you launch an object straight up from the surface of the Earth and want it to avoid being pulled back by gravity, it must leave the surface of Earth at what's called the escape velocity.
                    Escape velocity is also defined for other large objects such as planets, moons, and stars.
                    The escape velocity from the surface of the Earth is about <m>11,200</m> meters per second.
                    The escape velocity from the surface of the Moon is about <m>21.25%</m> of the escape velocity from the surface of the Earth.
                    Calculate the escape velocity from the surface of the Moon in meters per second using the correct number of significant figures.

                            <m>11,200</m> meters per second has three significant figures, and <m>21.25%</m> has four significant figures.
                            Since we are multiplying, the answer should have three significant figures.
