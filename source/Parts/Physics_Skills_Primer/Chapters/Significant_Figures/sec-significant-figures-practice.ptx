        <!-- Practice Question 01 --> <!-- Escape velocity of Earth and Moon -->
        <exercise xml:id ="practice-sig-figs-01">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    If you launch an object straight up from the surface of the Earth and want it to avoid being pulled back by gravity, it must leave the surface of Earth at what's called the escape velocity.
                    Escape velocity is also defined for other large objects such as planets, moons, and stars.
                    The escape velocity from the surface of the Earth is about 11,200 m/s.
                    Where m is meters and s is seconds.
                    The escape velocity from the surface of the Moon is about 21.25% of the escape velocity from the surface of the Earth.
                    Calculate the escape velocity from the surface of the Moon in meters per second using the correct number of significant figures.

                            11,200 m/s has three significant figures, and 21.25% has four significant figures.
                            Since we are multiplying, the answer should have three significant figures.

                            Since one measurement (121) has zero decimal places, the result must be rounded to zero decimal places as well.

                            The basic definition of an average is to add all the numbers together and then divide by the total number of values.
                            For example, the average of 1, 4, and 7 is: <m>\frac{1+4+7}{3} = 4</m>
