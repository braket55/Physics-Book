    <title>Significant Figures</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            Whether brewing a potion, calibrating a starship engine, or decoding alien glyphs, the smallest mistake can turn triumph into catastrophe. 
            That's why careful minds rely on the ancient art of significant figures.

        <p>
            Each digit in a number holds meaning. Some digits are trustworthy messengers, others are mere illusions. 
            Significant figures tell you which numbers are true companions and which are just cosmic noise.

            Take a mass spectrometer aboard a deep-space probe, it doesn't just spit out numbers for fun. 
            It captures bits of alien atmospheres, sifts through that ionized dust, and offers data etched with meaning. 
            A reading of <m>4.20</m> tells you more than <m>4.2</m> ever could; that final zero isn't decoration, it's a promise of precision.
            And what about a reading of <m>004.20</m>? The leading zeros are but shadows, offering no real insight over what <m>4.20</m> tells you.
        </p>

        <p>
            By counting only the figures that matter, you wield the power to communicate with percision. 
            It's the trusted cantrip of alchemists, data druids, and quantum sages alike.
