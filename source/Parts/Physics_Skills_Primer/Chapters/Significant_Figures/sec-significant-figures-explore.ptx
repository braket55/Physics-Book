                    <p>
                        The mean diameter of the Moon is about <m>3475000</m> meters.
                        Since the Moon is roughly spherical, we can calculate its volume using the formula: <m>V = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^{3}</m>, where <m>R</m> is the radius.
                        Calculate the volume of the Moon and express your answer in scientific notation with the correct number of significant figures.
                    </p>
                </statement>

                <hint>
                    <p>
                        The 4 and 3 in the fraction <m>\frac{4}{3}</m> are exact numbers, so they do not affect the number of significant figures.
                        The radius is half the diameter, so <m>R = \frac{3475000}{2} = 1737500</m> meters.
                        The given diameter has four significant figures, and we are multiplying it by itself three times in the volume formula, so the final answer should also have four significant figures.

                        <m>r = \frac{3475000 \, \text{meters}}{2} = 1737500 \, \text{meters}</m>. Do not round yet, as we will keep all significant figures until the end.

                    <p>
                        Our original value of the diameter has four sig figs, and we are muliplying itself three time in the volume equaiton.
                        So our volume should have four sig figs.<m>V = 2.197166906 \times 10^{19} \, \text{meters}^{3}</m>.
