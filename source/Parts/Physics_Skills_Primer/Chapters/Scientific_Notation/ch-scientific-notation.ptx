    <title>Scientific Notation</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            In the land of science, numbers can grow as vast as a dragon's hoard or shrink as small as a quark's shadow.
            But wise scholars and clever spellcasters don't waste time counting endless zeros, they use a magical cantrip called scientific notation.
        </p>
        <p>
            With just one enchanted rule: write a number between <m>1</m> and <m>10</m>, then multiply by a power of ten, you can tame even the wildest figures.
            A beast like <m>5000</m> becomes <m>5 \times 10^3 </m>, and a whisper-small <m>0.0002</m> transforms into <m>2 \times 10^{-4} </m>.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's the secret spell of astronomers,  constructs, and magic folk everywhere.
            Use it wisely, and even the stars won't feel out of reach.

            The below definition of position is just a test entry for the notation symbol list.  I'll remove this eventually.
            I could comment it out but I want to make sure it shows up properly first.
