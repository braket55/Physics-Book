                        To write 0.000000099 in scientific notation, move the decimal point <em>eight places to the right</em> to place it after the first nonzero digit.
                        This gives "9.9".
                        Since the decimal moved right by eight places, the exponent on 10 is -8.

                        To write 0.0012 in scientific notation, move the decimal point <em>three places to the right</em> to place it after the first nonzero digit.

                    <p>
                        To write 1.75 in scientific notation, the decimal is already after the first nonzero digit, so we don’t need to move it.
                        That means the exponent on 10 is 0.

                    <p>
                        So, <m>1.75 = 1.75 \times 10^{0}</m>.

                        The exponent for the human's height is 0, and for the grain of sand it is -3.

                        Compare the exponents: <m>10^{0}</m> vs.
                        <m>10^{-8}</m>.
                        How many powers of ten apart are they?

                    <p>
                        The exponent for the human's height is 0, and for the virus it is -8.
                        The difference is <m>0 - (-8) = 8</m>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So, a human is approximately <em>8 orders of magnitude</em> larger than the influenza virus.
                        This means the human is about <m>10^8 = 100,000,000</m> times taller than the virus.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In other words, if you stacked 100,000,000 viruses end to end, they would reach about the height of one person!
