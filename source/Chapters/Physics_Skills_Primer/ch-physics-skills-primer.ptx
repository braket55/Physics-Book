  <title>Scientific Notation</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> 
      In the land of science, numbers can grow as vast as a dragon's hoard or shrink as small as a quark's shadow. 
      But wise scholars and clever spellcasters don't waste time counting endless zeros, they use a magical cantrip called scientific notation. 
    </p>

    <p> 
      With just one enchanted rule: write a number between 1 and 10, then multiply by a power of ten, you can tame even the wildest figures. 
      A beast like 5,000 becomes <m> 5 \times 10^3 </m>, and a whisper-small 0.0002 transforms into <m> 2 \times 10^{-4} </m>.
    </p>

    <p> 
      It's the secret spell of astronomers,  constructs, and magic folk everywhere.
      Use it wisely, and even the stars won't feel out of reach. 
    </p>
